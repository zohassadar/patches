    This is Stack Mode. Based on the Stack Mode from Not Tetris 2, this variant of Tetris does not allow lines to clear. Instead, the goal is to get as many pieces onto the board as possible. Each piece gives your score one point and will save to the high score board.
    Do you think you can achieve a perfect 50 piece game?

    No pause-screen blackout (still see field, but not current or next blocks)
    Copyright and rocket screen skip
    Higher frequency of straight pieces
    10-frame pause before each piece begins dropping automatically
    It was designed to emulate a variety of classic and modern games, and act as a sort of hybrid between the two.

    "Welcome to Zentris.
    This ROM Hack of Tetris released by Nintendo in 1989 takes stacking blocks in a more relaxing direction.
    To start, the visuals have been overhauled to a more minimalist design. Inspired by Tetris Effect, the blocks are designed with a singular color for each level.
    The gameplay has been modified to make it as relaxing as possible. The game no longer increases the speed of gravity as you play, allowing for casual stacking of your own liking.
     Included are two patches. One is the standard version that has Level 0 Gravity. The second version has Gravity completely turned off, meaning you will have to press down to move the pieces.
    Now one might be concerned that this lack of gravity would result in a lot of holding down on the D-Pad and tired thumbs. Do not fret!
    To avoid any kind of sore thumbs, a hard drop was added. Simply press Up on the D-Pad to send the block instantly to the bottom!
    In Zentris, there are two game modes.
    The first is A-Type. This is your standard Tetris game. Stack for as long as you would like without topping out.
    For more fun, the score cap has been removed.
    The second mode is B-Type. In this, you must clear a preset number of lines with a chosen height  of garbage lines.
    In the standard version of NES Tetris, you are supposed to clear 25 lines. HOWEVER, in Zentris, the line amount has been raised to 80 lines!
    Try to see if you can clear all the level 5 garbage height before clearing 80 lines.
    Some other changes are listed below
    -New high scoreboard entries
    -You can see the board while the game is paused
    -The copyright/credit screen can be skipped by pressing start
    -Music is set to OFF by default
    A Quick Mode variant of the game has been added as well. In this version, the game skips all menus and goes straight into a Level 0 game.
    In Quick Mode, you are unable to return to the menu. If you would like to start another game of Quick Mode, you will have to soft or hard reset.
    To access these ROM Hacks, simply apply any of the included patches to a vanilla copy of the Tetris(USA) ROM
    Special thanks to zohassadar and the rest of the Classic Tetris Monthly discord for their help with this mod.

    Relax and have fun :)"
