    Originally posted in #romhacking:

      Played around with trying to make NES tetris feel like GameBoy tetris.  The board has been shortened, the pieces enter a row lower, there's a 2 frame spawn delay, slower das, different level drop rates, levels capped at 20, slower soft drop speed and a ridiculously long 91 frame blinking animation.  These were all the features I managed to cram in while enjoying megamasters today.  There's still work that would need to be done to the shift behavior, when the levels increment and the RNG (and possibly other stuff I'm not aware of)  in order to call it complete.  I'm probably going to abandon this effort so I'm leaving this here.  I like NES tetris better.

    This says in progress, but only because of how it was originally posted in discord.  There is no ongoing development for this version.

    Original writeup:
    Here's a mod to the B type that requires clearing all the garbage in order to succeed, inspired by the checkerboard mode.  I'm open to ideas on how the scoring should be modified or a better way to show the garbage tiles that distinguishes them from the regular tiles.   I have a few ideas on scoring but they all require leveling up some more in 6502.  For now I need to focus on that which provides, even though romhacking is more fun.

    (posted by triskai in anytourney discord)

    it's like literally just, n lines adds 2n-1 combo, and current line clear scores the amount the current combo meter is at
    so tetrises into a bunch of singles are really strong, for instance
    the stuff below 7 combo doesn't matter much (sub-tetris scoring) but after that you get a tetris worth of scoring until you get to 14 combo and it's 2k per level, then it just goes up 1k per level every 7 combo
    and it glitches and reads garbage data once you get 34 combo (iirc? maybe 35), which is kind of more an easter egg than a glitch, given that's basically tas-only

  desc: |
    Meditatris offers an inversion of traditional video game values.  You cannot gain points by taking risks, and you cannot affect the game's speed once you have begun.  This is Games Done Slow: the number of sustained minutes of attention you choose to give to the game represents its only measure of your success.

    Currently, the majority of meditation falls into one of two modes: sitting meditation and walking meditation.  In either case, the instruction comprises "Focus on your anchor.  When you discover that your attention has strayed, make mental note of that, then return your focus to your anchor."  In sitting meditation the breath typically serves as the anchor.  Walking meditation presents two main options: the yogi (meditator) may walk as slowly as they can, anchoring their attention on each individual footfall.  Alternatively they may walk at a modest pace and anchor their open attention on all sensory input.  Sitting very still for many consecutive hours on intensive retreat can cause injury, so walking meditation offers the benefit that by switching between sitting and walking meditation, yogis can safely meditate all day.

    Gaming meditation offers a third mode of meditation.  It operates under the same instruction: "Focus on the game.  When you discover that your attention has strayed, notice that.  Then return your focus to the game."  This is the whole of the practice.

    Sit or lay comfortably.  Feel free to mindfully adjust your posture as needed as you game.  Like walking meditation, gaming meditation presents two disparate potential approaches:
    1) Play as slowly as you possibly can.  Set the game level to 0, and focus your attention on each. individual. line. fall. that each piece makes as it drops.  This parallels to anchoring on your footfalls in walking meditation while walking as slowly as you can.
    or 2) Choose a level slow enough that, for your specific skill as a Tetris player, given your directed attention you can play sustainably for an indefinite amount of time without topping out.  Then give the game your full attention for an extended period of time.  This serves as a parallel to opening your attention during walking meditation.

    Every meditation tradition presents potential pitfalls. For gaming meditation, rather than meditating, you may find yourself just hanging out and playing video games; the game may merely offer another distraction rather than a useful anchor for sustained directed focus.  The responsibility here ultimately falls to the yogi.  If you find the game more distracting than useful, by all means transition your practice to feature more traditional sitting meditation and less gaming meditation.  However, if you wish to increase your useful attention span, and you haven't found the motivation to spend more time sitting in meditation... Meditatris can offer a valuable additional mode to add minutes to your daily practice.

    Deric Miller, December 2020




    Modifications to the original ROM include:
    - Level (and speed) never increase as you complete lines, so you can play indefinitely.
    - You can no longer soft drop pieces down, so the pace of the game remains constant and out of your hands.
    - You can no longer see the number of lines you've completed or the specific piece statistics so that you can focus on the present, not the past.
    - You can no longer see the next piece, so you can focus on the present rather than the future.
    - You can no longer pause the game, because sustained attention is the game.
    - You can no longer see your score during play so that you won't be distracted by taking stock during play.
    - And finally, your score now represents the number of consecutive minutes you've played, because the game has no valuable quantifiable aspect other than time.

    Also:
    - The game screen now lacks extraneous decoration.
    - Each tetrad now features its own unique block sprite.
    - The game uses one unified color palette across all speed levels.
    - No music plays throughout the game.
    - The title screen features some graphical tweaks.
    - An instruction screen replaces the Game Type selection screen.
    - The default high scores table features lower, individually achievable high scores.

    This was originally posted in #romhacking:

    In trying to catch up a bit on the years of knowledge in this channel, I found scrolltris and thought it was neat.  It made me want to mess around with PPUSCROLL so I came up with the idea of keeping the piece still and moving the screen instead.  I don't like it, it made me feel sick testing it.

    This started as me wanting garbage row options between 19-2 and 19-3, because the increase in difficulty between those two is steep (for me at least), so I wanted a mod where you could choose garbage by rows instead of by the arbitrary heights.  I also thought it'd be cool to change the goal lines without game genie codes as well as having the ability to reuse the same garbage field.  Lastly I wanted to be able to start an A game with B garbage.  Choosing 0 for B Lines means you gotta clear the original garbage to win.  I tried to understand the TetrisGYM scoring for the checkerboard so I could incorporate something similar (or the same) for that mode, but I'm not quite there yet so I've saved that challenge for another day.  In the mean time the scoring for that starts at FF and counts down by lines cleared in hex.   If you choose B game with 0 rows and 0 lines, it's very easy to win quickly.   Huge thanks to Kirjava and Fractal161 for the source code that greatly assisted with building the menu.

  file: Tetris (USA) SNES.ips

  - Josh Tolles

  desc: |
    NES and SNES are very similar in game mechanics. They obey the exact same auto-shift and delayed-auto-shift rules (this is referring to moving the pieces left and right). They also follow the same rules for each level’s fall/drop rate (the speed at which the pieces fall to the bottom of the screen). But there is one major difference between NES and SNES game mechanics.

    While it is true that both games match each other in falling speed (the rate at which the piece falls to the bottom), there is a difference in the rules of gravity between the two games. In NES, gravity is in effect as soon as the next piece has been generated, while in SNES, gravity doesn’t kick in until ten frames of screen time have passed. That means that SNES gives you ten frames of game time in which the piece is “floating”–you can begin to move the piece left or right during this time, it’s active but not falling. NES does not give you any sort of “head start”–as soon as your piece appears, it is already falling.

    Ten frames amounts to 1/6 of a second. The game displays 60 frames per second, and ten frames is 10 out of 60. That is a really big deal for the Tetris Master.

    This patch adds the pre-gravity behaviour from the SNES version of Tetris (from “Tetris & Dr. Mario”) without affecting natural drop speeds of the NES release.

    Also includes a version for the “Tetris Zero” hack.

    This is Stack Mode. Based on the Stack Mode from Not Tetris 2, this variant of Tetris does not allow lines to clear. Instead, the goal is to get as many pieces onto the board as possible. Each piece gives your score one point and will save to the high score board.
    Do you think you can achieve a perfect 50 piece game?

    This is a 2 player hack for the NES version of Tetris. In order to accomplish this, the ROM was converted from MMC1 to MMC3. The PRG was expanded to have 2 additional PRG banks.

    Also, a custom bankswap routine was added since no bankswap was present in the original ROM. The following features were added:

      Enabled 2 player mode.
      Created custom controls for 2nd player on non & in-game screens.
      Created custom designs for A/B-Type 2 player mode.
      Created asm to allow 2nd player to have stats shown on in-game screen.
      Player 2 has the ability to write their name into the scoreboard.
      Added a new gameplay feature to the B-Type Mode. In B-Type mode, in order to win 25 lines must be cleared. There is now the ability to choose how many lines to clear. There is a choice from 01-80 lines to clear.
      Player 2 now has the ability to obtain their own game piece, no longer sharing/stealing from player 1.
      Player 2 now has a proper NEXT piece box, along with working select button to enable/disable display.
      Player 2 now has the ability to select an additional +10 levels from what they choose from A/B-Type (player 1 can hold the A button down when they have level 0-9 highlighted, and when they press start with A button held, the player will start +10 levels from what was selected. Player 2 can also do the same thing. However, this can only be done while player 2 holds down the B button. When player 1 presses start, player 2 needs to have the B button held down in order to get the +10 level).
      The archive also includes a .sav file for those who own a powerpak for the NES.

    This hack simply modifies the tetrominoes to take on more complex shapes, making the game more difficult. The “STATISTICS” graphics are also modified accordingly.

    "Welcome to Zentris.
    This ROM Hack of Tetris released by Nintendo in 1989 takes stacking blocks in a more relaxing direction.
    To start, the visuals have been overhauled to a more minimalist design. Inspired by Tetris Effect, the blocks are designed with a singular color for each level.
    The gameplay has been modified to make it as relaxing as possible. The game no longer increases the speed of gravity as you play, allowing for casual stacking of your own liking.
     Included are two patches. One is the standard version that has Level 0 Gravity. The second version has Gravity completely turned off, meaning you will have to press down to move the pieces.
    Now one might be concerned that this lack of gravity would result in a lot of holding down on the D-Pad and tired thumbs. Do not fret!
    To avoid any kind of sore thumbs, a hard drop was added. Simply press Up on the D-Pad to send the block instantly to the bottom!
    In Zentris, there are two game modes.
    The first is A-Type. This is your standard Tetris game. Stack for as long as you would like without topping out.
    For more fun, the score cap has been removed.
    The second mode is B-Type. In this, you must clear a preset number of lines with a chosen height  of garbage lines.
    In the standard version of NES Tetris, you are supposed to clear 25 lines. HOWEVER, in Zentris, the line amount has been raised to 80 lines!
    Try to see if you can clear all the level 5 garbage height before clearing 80 lines.
    Some other changes are listed below
    -New high scoreboard entries
    -You can see the board while the game is paused
    -The copyright/credit screen can be skipped by pressing start
    -Music is set to OFF by default
    A Quick Mode variant of the game has been added as well. In this version, the game skips all menus and goes straight into a Level 0 game.
    In Quick Mode, you are unable to return to the menu. If you would like to start another game of Quick Mode, you will have to soft or hard reset.
    To access these ROM Hacks, simply apply any of the included patches to a vanilla copy of the Tetris(USA) ROM
    Special thanks to zohassadar and the rest of the Classic Tetris Monthly discord for their help with this mod.

    Relax and have fun :)"
